% demoBuildCity
%
% Simply running this command will run the default demo project animation. This
% animation can be used as a baseline to see what is expected of you, but you do
% not have to emulate the behavior of the demo.
%
% demoBuildCity incImg
%
% Running the demo with the input 'incImg' will map skyscraper wall textures to
% the walls of the skyscrapers, as well as apply an image to the top of the
% buildings. This should give you an idea of how you can use the 5th input of
% the makeBuilding helper function to make your buildings look more
% building-like.
%
% The demo will run at different speeds depending on the hardware you run it on.
% However, it will stop after 20 seconds regardless of whether or not the
% animation has completed. To stop the animation at any time, you can use CTRL+C
